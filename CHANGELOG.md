# TShock for Terraria

This is the rolling changelog for TShock for Terraria. Use past tense when adding new entries; sign your name off when you add or change something. This should primarily be things like user changes, not necessarily codebase changes unless it's really relevant or large.

## How to add a changelog entry
* Put your entry in terms of what you changed in the past mood. For example: "Changed the world by adding new grommets."
  * Not "fix" or "change".
  * The entry must start with a verb.
  * End your sentence with a period.
  * Write in complete sentences that are understandable by anyone who does not have experience programming, unless the change is related to programming.
  * Do not insert tabs into this file, under any circumstances, ever.
  * Do not forget to sign every line you change with your name. (@hakusaro)
  * If there is no section called "Upcoming changes" below this line, please add one with `## Upcoming changes` as the first line, and then a bulleted item directly after with the first change.

## Upcoming changes
* Changed the world autosave message so that it no longer warns of a "potential lag spike." (@hakusaro)
* Added `/slay` as an alias for `/kill` to be more consistent with other server mods. (@hakusaro)
* Added `/god` as an alias for `/godmode` to be more consistent with other server mods. (@hakusaro)
* Fixed ridiculous typo in `Amethyst Gemtree` text. (@hakusaro)
* Fixed `CTRL + C` / interactive console interrupt not safely shutting down the server. Now, interrupts will cause a safe shutdown (saving the world and disconnecting all players before fully shutting down). Previously, interrupts caused an unsafe shutdown (not saving the world). (@hakusaro)
* Changed "success message" color to `Color.LimeGreen` instead of `Color.Green`. `Color.Green` looks ugly. `Color.LimeGreen` looks less ugly but isn't as offensively bright as pure green. (@hakusaro)
* Changed the default respawn timer to 10 seconds, so as to not desynchronize from the game by default. (@hakusaro)
* Fixed `/home` allowing players to bypass the respawn timer. (@hakusaro, @moisterrific, @Arthri)
* Added the config option `SuppressPermissionFailureNotices`. When set to `true`, the server will not send warning messages to players when they fail a build permission check from `TSPlayer.HasBuildPermission` (even if `shouldWarnPlayer` is set to true. (@hakusaro)
* Fixed `/warp send` failing a nullcheck if the warp didn't exist. The previous behavior may have always been buggy or broken. In other words, sending someone to a warp that doesn't exist should result in a nicer error. (@hakusaro, @punchready)
* Fixed `/group del` allowing server operators to delete the default group that guests are put into. This is a really critical group and the server doesn't behave correctly when it happens. As a result, it's better to prevent this from happening than not. Additionally, `GroupManagerException`s will be thrown if this is attempted programmatically. Finally, if the exception is thrown in response to `/group del` (or if any other exception is thrown that the command handler can handle), the stack trace will no longer be present. Fixes [#2165](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock/issues/2165). (@hakusaro, @DeveloperLuxo, @Rozen4334, @moisterrific, @bartico6, @Quinci135)
* Removed the old `ConfigFile` class. If you are updating a plugin, you should use `TShock.Config.Settings` instead of the accessor you were using. This is typically a really easy change. For most plugin authors, updating to the new config format is as simple as changing the reference to the old static config to point to the new location. If you were using this for your own configs, you should swap to using a `IConfigFile` (see `TShockAPI.Configuration.ConfigFile`). (@hakusaro, @bartico6)
* Added `Main.worldPathName` to `/worldinfo` command. Now, if you need to see what the location on disk for your world file is, you can simply run `/worldinfo` to find out. This is particularly helpful on Linux and macOS, where the world path isn't obvious. (@hakusaro)
* Correct rejection message in LandGolfBallInCupHandler to output the proper expected player id. (@drunderscore)
* Clarified the error mesage that the console is presented if a rate-limit is reached over REST to indicate that "tokens" actually refers to rate-limit tokens, and not auth tokens, and added a hint as to what config setting determines this. (@hakusaro, @patsore)
* Fixed an issue where, when the console was redirected, input was disabled and commands didn't work, in TSAPI. You can now pass `-disable-commands` to disable the input thread, but by default, it will be enabled. Fixes [#1450](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock/issues/1450). (@DeathCradle, @QuiCM)
* Added `summonboss` permission check for Prismatic Lacewing. Players who do not have said permission will be unable to kill this critter, as it will summon the Empress of Light. Also added support for the `AnonymousBossInvasions` config option, if this is set to `false` it will now broadcast the name of the player who summoned her. (@moisterrific)
* Added `ForceTime` config setting check for Enchanted Sundial usage. If `ForceTime` is set to anything other than `normal`, Sundial use will be rejected as this would lead to very janky game behavior. Additionally, players with `cfgreload` permission will be advised  to change it back to `normal` in order to use sundial. (@moisterrific, @bartico6)
* Added `%onlineplayers%` and `%serverslots%` placeholders for MOTD. The default MOTD message was also updated to use this. (@moisterrific, @bartico6)

## TShock 4.5.4
* Fixed ridiculous typo in `GetDataHandlers` which caused TShock to read the wrong field in the packet for `usingBiomeTorches`. (@hakusaro, @Arthri)
* Fixed torchgod settings to include whether or not torchgod has been fought by the player before and respect `usingBiomeTorches` setting. (@Quinci135)
* Fixed /worldmode not synchronising data to players after updating the world state (@bartico6, @Arthri)
* Added `OnSendNetData` hook to TSAPI, which enables developers to intercept traffic being sent from the server to clients using the new NetPacket protocol. (@Stealownz)
* Fixed false positive `OnNPCAddBuff` detection when throwing rotten eggs at town NPCs while wearing Frost armor set. (@moisterrific)
* Moved the emoji player index check into a new class of handlers called `IllegalPerSe`, which is designed to help isolate parts of TShock and make it so that "protocol violations" are treated separately from heuristic based anti-cheat checks. (@hakusaro)
* Changed `TSPlayer.FindByNameOrID` so that it will continue searching for players and return a list of many players whem ambiguous matches exist in all cases. Specifically, this avoids a scenario where a griefer names themselves `1` and is difficult to enact justice on, because their name will not be found by the matching system used to kick players. To help with ambiguity, this method now processes requests with prefixes `tsi:` and `tsn:`. `tsi:[number]` will process the search as looking for an exact player by ID. `tsn:` will process the search as looking for an exact name, case sensitive. In both cases, the system will return an exact result in the "old-style" result, i.e., a `List<TSPlayer>` with exactly one result. For example, `/kick tsid:1` will match the player with the ID `1`. `/kick tsn:1` will match the username `1`. In addition, players who attempt to join the server with the name prefixes `tsn:` and `tsi:` will be rejected for having invalid names. (@hakusaro, @Onusai)
* Added warnings for conditions where a password is set at runtime but can be bypassed. The thinking is that if a user sets a password when they're booting the server, that's what they expect to be the password. The only thing is that sometimes, other config options can basically defeat this as a security feature. The goal is just to communicate more and make things clearer. The server also warns users when UUID login is enabled, because it can be confusing and insecure. (@hakusaro, @Onusai)
* Fixed Torch God's Favor biome torch placement being rejected by the server. (@moisterrific)
* Changed backups created by the backup manager to use ISO8601-style timestamps. I say "style" because it's impossible to implement ISO8601 or RFC3389 dates in a filename on most modern filesystems. So instead of the proper ISO separators, we've got dashes and dots. (@hakusaro, change sponsored by @drunderscore)
* Added hook for `OnDoorUse` (`DoorUse`) and associated `DoorUseEventArgs` fired when a door is used. Also added `GetDataHandlers.DoorAction` enum for determining the action of a door. (@hakusaro)
* Disallowed loading of the AutoRegister plugin version 1.2.0 or lower. Versions of this plugin at or equal to 1.2.0 use low entropy material to create passwords. This effectively means that it's possible for any user to be easily impersonated on a server running AutoRegister by simply convincing a user to join a malicious server, even when UUID login is disabled. This was assigned [GHSA-w3h6-j2gm-qf7q](https://github.com/Pryaxis/Plugins/security/advisories/GHSA-w3h6-j2gm-qf7q). (@hakusaro)
* Disallowed loading of another plugin due to [security issue GHSA-qj59-99v9-3gww](https://github.com/Pryaxis/Plugins/security/advisories/GHSA-qj59-99v9-3gww). Due to the importance of this issue and severity, information is not available in the changelog. Information will be available [June 8th, 2021, at 12:00 MDT](https://time.is/1200PM_8_June_2021_in_Littleton?GHSA-qj59-99v9-3gww_information_release). (@hakusaro)

## TShock 4.5.3
* Added permissions for using Teleportation Potions, Magic Conch, and Demon Conch. (@drunderscore)
  * `tshock.tp.tppotion`, `tshock.tp.magicconch`, and `tshock.tp.demonconch` respectively.
* Updated HealOtherPlayer damage check to make more sense by respecting `ignoredamagecap` permission. (@moisterrific)
* Added preliminary support for Terraria 1.4.2.3 (@moisterrific, @Moneylover3246, @DeathCradle)
* Added celebration mk2 explosive to explosives ItemID set in TSAPI. Solves #2304. (@Quinci135)
* TShock now writes its log files to the `logs` folder inside the `tshock` folder by default, as opposed to just the `tshock` folder. (@QuiCM)
* The default MOTD is now prettier. The MOTD format can now contain `%specifier%` to send the command specifier. (@moisterrific)
* The buff commands now support `-1` as a time option to set buffs that last 415 days (the maximum buff time the game supports). (@moisterrific)
* TShock defaults to saving backups every 10 minutes, and defaults to keeping backups for 4 hours. (@hakusaro)
* Updated SSC bypass messaging. Now, when you connect, you're told if you're bypassing SSC. Console logging has been improved to warn when players are not being saved due to the bypass SSC permission. To turn this warning off, change `WarnPlayersAboutBypassPermission` to `false` in the `sscconfig.json` file. (@hakusaro)
* Fix oversight & exploit allowing specially crafted SendTileRectangle packets to perform large-scale world griefing. In addition, `NetTile.Slope` is now the native value (byte), and accessor methods `Slope1`, `Slope2`, and `Slope3` can be used to get the old style of values out. `HalfBrick` and `Actuator` were removed from `NetTile` because these were initialized to zero and never changed or used. (@bartico6)

## TShock 4.5.2
* Added preliminary support for Terraria 1.4.2.2. (@hakusaro)
* Removed `/ungodme` and godmode warning (no longer necessary). Also, godmode now supports silent commands. (@hakusaro)
* Added permission 'tshock.rest.broadcast' to the /v2/server/broadcast REST endpoint. (@TheBambino)

## TShock 4.5.1
* Fixed server crash from `/v2/players/list` & other parameterised REST endpoints. (@QuiCM, reported by @ATFGK)
* Added handling to the PlayerChat hook event. (@QuiCM - Thanks for the suggestion @Arthri)
* Changed the spawnboss command to support silent command specifiers. (@QuiCM, suggested by @nojomyth-dev)
* Updated /godmode to use Journey Mode's Godmode power instead of healing on damage. (requested by @tlworks, backported by @bartico6, implemented preemptive bugfix for creative powers mentioned by @Stealownz)
* Fixed /r attempting to send messages to players that have since disconnected. (@bartico6, reported by @Arthri)
* Added ban ticket ID to ban messages (@QuiCM, suggested by @Bippity)
* Refactored /wallow command. /reply no longer bypasses /wallow (@QuiCM)

## TShock 4.5.0.1
* Fixed conversion from old to new ban system for MySQL hosted ban databases. (@DeathCradle, @ATFGK)
* Fixed wrong identifier used for UUID bans. (@DeathCradle, @ATFGK)
* Fixed conversion from sqlite bans due to locking issue. (@DeathCradle, @Kojirremer)

## TShock 4.5.0
* Updated OTAPI and TSAPI to Terraria 1.4.2.1. (@Stealownz, @DeathCradle)
* Updated TShock with preliminary protocol support for Terraria 1.4.2.1. (@Stealownz)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 16)
* Patched protocol issue. Thanks to Off (@tlworks) and @bartico6 for contributions, including packet captures, packet analysis, exploit proof-of-concept testing, patch testing, and detailed reproduction steps. (@hakusaro)
* Disabled debug by default. (@hakusaro)
* Changed "WinVer" field in `/serverinfo` to "Operating System". (@Terrabade)
* Rewritten `/grow`, added every default tree type & changed the default help response. (@Nova4334)
  * Added a new permission: `tshock.world.growevil` to prevent players to grow evil biome trees, these trees spawn with evil biome blocks below them.
* Introduced `/wallow` to disable or enable recieving whispers from other players. (@Nova4334)
* Removed stoned & webbed from disabled status (@QuiCM)
* Fix -forceupdate flag not forcing updates (@Quake)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 15)
* Overhauled Bans system. Bans are now based on 'identifiers'. (@QuiCM)
  * The old Bans table (`Bans`) has been deprecated. New bans will go in `PlayerBans`. Old bans will be converted automatically to the new system.
  * All old ban routes in REST are now redirected. Please use `/v3/bans/*` for REST-based ban management.
  * TShock recognizes and acts upon 4 main identifiers: UUID, IP, Player Name, Account name. This can be extended by plugins. New identifiers can be added to the `ban help identifiers` output by registering them in `TShockAPI.DB.Identifier.Register(string, string)`
  * By default, bans are no longer removed upon expiry or 'deletion'. Instead, they remain in the system. A new ban for an indentifier can be added once an existing ban has expired.
* Server Console now understands Terraria color codes (e.g., `[c/FF00FF:Words]`) and prints the colored text to the console. Note that console colors are limited and thus only approximations. (@QuiCM)
* Fixed a bug in `/sudo` that prevented quoted arguments being forwarded properly. Example: `/sudo /user group "user name" "user group"` should now work correctly. (@QuiCM)
* Shutting down the server should now correctly display the shutdown message to players rather than 'Lost connection'. (@QuiCM)
* For developers: TShock now provides `IConfigFile<TSettings>` and `ConfigFile<TSettings>` under the `TShockAPI.Configuration` namespace. No more needing to copy/pasting the same Read/Write code for your plugin configs. (@QuiCM)
  * `ConfigFile<TSettings>` implements `Read` and `Write` for you.
  * Check `TShockConfig` and `ServerSideConfig` for examples on how to use.
* Added URI un-escaping on all inputs into REST. (@QuiCM)
* Attempt to fix platinum coin pickup dupe. (Thanks @Quinci135)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 14)
* Terraria v1.4.1.2 (Thanks @Patrikkk and @DeathCradle <3)
* Added Torch God's Favor support in SSC. (@Stealownz)
* SendTileSquare is now SendTileRect and can now send rectangles instead of squares. This is a breaking change (@QuiCM)
* Destroying protected tiles underneath a tile object no longer causes the tile object to disappear for the client (@QuiCM)
* 'RegionProtectGemLocks' config option now works correctly. Gems can now be placed in Gem Locks while this option is enabled (@QuiCM)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 13)
* Terraria v1.4.1.1
* Added Gravedigger's Shovel support. (@Zennos)
* You can now start up multiple TShock servers at once without getting a startup error. (@ZakFahey)
* Updated bouncer to include new Magma Stone, Frost Armor, and Spinal Tap inflicted npc debuffs to bouncer. (@Quinci135)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 12)
* Fixed various bugs related to Snake Charmer's Flute. (@rustly)  
  * The entirety of the snake now places.  
  * The old snake now removes when placing a new snake.
  * Players are no longer disabled for breaking TilePlace/TileKill thresholds when modifying snakes.  
* Prevented players from seeing the npc spawnrate change permission error on join. (@rustly)
* Installed new sprinklers!
* Organized parameters by category and relevance in the `config.json` file. (@kubedzero)
* Fixed multiple holes in Bouncer OnTileData. (@Patrikkk, @hakusaro)
  * Issue where players could replace tiles with banned tiles without permission. 
  * Including replace action in TilePlace threshold incrementation, so players cannot bypass the threshold while replacing tiles/walls.
  * Including check for maxTileSets when player is replacing tiles, so players cannot send invalid tile data through the replace tile action.
  * Including a check for ReplaceWall when the tile is a Breakable/CutTile.
* Adding checks in Bouncer OnNewProjectile (@Patrikkk):
  * For valid golf club and golf ball creation.
  * Renamed stabProjectile to directionalProjectile for a more accurate naming.
  * Adding staff projectiles to the directionalProjectiles Dictionary to include staffs in the valid projectile creation check.
  * Adding GolfBallItemIDs list in Handlers.LandGolfBallInCupHandler.cs
* Fixed an issue in the SendTileSquare handler that was rejecting valid tile objects. (@QuiCM)
* Fixed the issue where players were unable to place regular ropes because of the valid placement being caught in Bouncer OnTileEdit. (@Patrikkk)
* Added pet license usage permissions to `trustedadmin` and `owner` groups. Do note that this has a high network usage and can be easily be abused so it is not recommended to give out this permission to lower level groups. (@moisterrific) 
* Removed checks that prevented people placing personal storage tiles in SSC as the personal storage is synced with the server. (@Patrikkk)
* Cleaned up a check in Bouner OnTileEdit where it checks for using the respective item when placing a tile to make it clearer. This change also fixed the issue in a previous commit where valid replace action was caught. Moved the check for max tile/wall types to the beginning of the method. (@Patrikkk)
* Improved clarity for insufficient permission related error messages. (@moisterrific)
* Removed redundant Boulder placement check that prevented placing chests on them, as it is no longer possible to place a chest on a boulder, so nothing crashes the server. "1.2.3: Boulders with Chests on them no longer crash the game if the boulder is hit." (@kevzhao2, @Patrikkk)
* `/itemban` - `/projban` - `/tileban` - Added a `default:` case to the commands so an invalid subcommand promts the player to enter the help subcommand to get more information on valid subcommands. (@Patrikkk)
* `/world` - Renamed to /worldinfo to be more accurate to it's function. Command now displays the world's `Seed`. Reformatted the world information so each line isn't repeatedly starting with "World". (@Patrikkk)
* `/who` - Changed the display format of the online players when the `-i` flag is used. From `PlayerName (ID: 0, ID: 0)` to `PlayerName (Index: 0, Account ID: 0)` for clarification. (@Patrikkk)
* Added DisplayDollItemSync event. An event that is called when a player modifies the slot of a DisplayDoll (Mannequin). This event provides information about the current item in the displaydoll, as well as the item that the player is about to set. (@Patrikkk)
* Added DisplayDollItemSyncHandler, which checks for building permissions of the player at the position of the DisplayDoll. (If they do not have permissions, it means they are hacking as they could not even open the doll in the first place.) (@Patrikkk)
* Added RequestTileEntity packet handling. (@Patrikkk)
  * Implemented the OnRequestTileEntityInteraction even hook in GetDataHandler. (@Patrikkk)
  * Created RequestTileEntityInteractionHandler which checks for building permissions when the player is attempting to open a display doll (Mannequin) or a Hat Rack. This now prevents players from opening a Mannequin or a Hat Rack if they have no building permissions at the position of these tile entities. As of 1.4.0.5, these are the only two items that use this packet. (@Patrikkk)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 11)
* Added new permission `tshock.tp.pylon` to enable teleporting via Teleportation Pylons (@QuiCM)
* Added new permission `tshock.journey.research` to enable sharing research via item sacrifice (@QuiCM)
* Add Emoji event to GetDataHandler. This packet is received when a player tries to display an emote. (@Patrikkk)
  * Added EmojiHandler to handle an exploit. Adding `tshock.sendemoji` permission and checks. Added this permission to guest group by default. (@Patrikkk)
* Handled SyncCavernMonsterType packet to prevent an exploit where players could modify the server's cavern monster types and make the server spawn any NPCs - including bosses - onto other players. (@Patrikkk)
* Added LandGolfBallInCup event which is accessible for developers to work with, as well as LandGolfBallInCup handler to handle exploits where players could send direct packets to trigger and imitate golf ball cup landing anywhere in the game world. Added two public lists in Handlers.LandGolfBallInCupHandler: GolfBallProjectileIDs and GolfClubItemIDs. (@Patrikkk)
* Added SyncTilePicking event. This is called when a player damages a tile. Implementing SyncTilePickingHandler and patching tile damaging related exploits. (Preventing player sending invalid world position data which disconnects other players.)
* Fixed the issue where mobs could not be fished out during bloodmoon because of Bouncer checks. (@Patrikkk)
  * Fixed the issue where certain fishing rods could not fish out NPCs due to a Bouncer check. (@Patrikkk)
* Update for OTAPI 2.0.0.37 and Terraria 1.4.0.5. (@hakusaro, @Patrikkk)
* Added additional config options for automatically kicking clients from the server upon breaking anti-cheat thresholds. (@moisterrific)
* Added pylon teleportation permission to default group, added `/spawn` permission to admin group, added the new journey mode research permission to trustedadmin, and moved all previous journey mode permissions from owner to trustedadmin. (@moisterrific)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 10)
* Fixed all rope coils. (@Olink)
* Fixed a longstanding issue with SendTileSquare that could result in desyncs and visual errors. (@QuiCM)
* Fixed placement issues with Item Frames, Teleportation Pylons, etc. (@QuiCM)
* Fixed doors, and they are good now for real probably. (@QuiCM, @Hakusaro, @Olink)
* Bumped default max damage received cap to 42,000 to accommodate the Empress of Light's instant kill death amount. (@hakusaro, @moisterrific, @Irethia, @Ayrawei)
* Updated `/spawnboss` command to include Empress of Light, Queen Slime, and other additional bosses that have a health bar. (@moisterrific)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 9)
* Fixed pet licenses. (@Olink)
* Added initial support for Journey mode in SSC worlds. (@Olink)
* Made TShock database MySQL 8 compatible by escaping column names in our IQueryBuilder code. (Name `Groups` is a reserved element in this version, which is used in our `Region` table.) (@Patrikkk)
* Reintroduced `-worldselectpath` per feedback from @fjfnaranjo. This command line argument should be used to specify the place where the interactive server startup will look for worlds to show on the world select screen. The original version of this argument, `-worldpath`, was removed because several game service providers have broken configurations that stop the server from running with an unhelpful error. This specific configuration was `-world` and `-worldpath`. In the new world, you can do the following:
  * `-worldselectpath` should be used if you want to customize the server interactive boot world list (so that you can select from a number of worlds in non-standard locations).
  * `-world` will behave as an absolute path to the world to load. This is the most common thing you want if you're starting the server and have a specific world in mind.
  * `-worldselectpath` and `-worldname` should work together enabling you to select from a world from the list that you specify. This is *not* a world file name, but a world name as described by Terraria.
  * `-worldselectpath` is identical to the old `-worldpath`. If you specify `-worldselectpath` and `-world` without specifying an absolute path the server will crash for sure.
  * Thank you again to @fjfnaranjo for supplying a [detailed feature request](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock/issues/1914) explaining precisely why this option should be available. Without this, we would have had no context as to why this feature was useful or important. Thank you, @fjfnaranjo!
  * This change was implemented by (@QuiCM, @hakusaro).
* Updated Bouncer to include Sparkle Slime debuff that can be applied to town NPCs. (@moisterrific)
* Updated `/spawnboss` command to include Empress of Light, Queen Slime, and other additional bosses that have a health bar. (@moisterrific)
* Added journey mode permissions to owner group by default. (@moisterrific)
* Fixed kick on hardcore death / kick on mediumcore death / ban on either from taking action against journey mode players. (@hakusaro)
* Attempted to fix the problem with the magic mirror spawn problems. You should be able to remove your spawn point in SSC by right clicking on a bed now. (@hakusaro, @AxeelAnder)
* Added HandleFoodPlatterTryPlacing event, which is called whenever a player places a food in a plate. Add antihack to bouncer, to prevent removing food from plates if the region is protected; To prevent placement if they are not in range; To prevent placement if the item is not placed from player hand. (@Patrikkk)
* Fixed an offset error in NetTile that impacted `SendTileSquare`. It was being read as a `byte` and not a `ushort`. (@QuiCM)
* Fixed coins not dropping after being picked up by npcs. The ExtraValue packet was not being read correctly. (@Olink)
* Removed packet monitoring from debug logs. To achieve the same results, install @QuiCM's packet monitor plugin (it does better things). (@hakusaro)
* Updated packet monitoring in send tile square handler for Bouncer debugging. (@hakusaro)
* Added `/sync`, activated with `tshock.synclocalarea`. This is a default guest permission. When the command is issued, the server will resync area around the player in the event of a desync issue. (@hakusaro)
  * If your doors disappear, this command will allow a player to resync without having to disconnect from the server.
  * The default group that gets this permission is `Guest` for the time being.
  * To add this command to your guest group, give them `tshock.synclocalarea`, with `/group addperm guest tshock.synclocalarea`.
  * This command may be removed at any time in the future (and will likely be removed when send tile square handling is fixed).
* Add FishOutNPC event handler, which is called whenever a player fishes out an NPC using a fishing rod. Added antihack to Bouncer, to prevent unathorized and invalid mob spawning, by checking player action, NPC IDs and range. (@Patrikkk, @moisterrific)
* Fixed smart door automatic door desync and deletion issue. (@hakusaro)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 8)
* Update for OTAPI 2.0.0.36 and Terraria 1.4.0.4. (@hakusaro, @Patrikkk, @DeathCradle)
* Fixed /wind command. (@AxeelAnder)
* Fixed NPC debuff issue when attempting to fight bosses resulting in kicks. (@AxeelAnder)
* Fixed players are unable to remove an NPC. Change `byte NPCHomeChangeEventArgs.Homeless` to `HouseholdStatus NPCHomeChangeEventArgs.HouseholdStatus`. (@AxeelAnder)
* Fixed lava, wet, honey, and dry bombs;  
  and lava, wet, honey, and dry grenades;  
  and lava, wet, honey, and dry rockets;  
  and lava, wet, honey, and dry mines. (@Olink)
* Fix Bloody Tear displaying the wrong text when used. (@Olink)
* Fix the visibility toggle for the last two accessory slots. (@Olink)

  * `tshock.journey.time.set`
  * `tshock.journey.time.setspeed`
  * `tshock.journey.godmode`
  * `tshock.journey.wind.strength`

  * `tshock.journey.setdifficulty`
  * `tshock.journey.biomespreadfreeze`
  * `tshock.journey.setspawnrate`
* Changed default thresholds for some changes in the config file to accommodate new items & changes to Terraria. (@hakusaro)
* Store projectile type in `ProjectileStruct RecentlyCreatedProjectiles` to identify the recently created projectiles by type. Make `RecentlyCreatedProjectiles` and `ProjectileStruct` public for developers to access from plugins.

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 7 (Entangled))
* Fixed bed spawn issues when trying to remove spawn point in SSC. (@Olink)
* Fixed Snake Flute. (@Olink)
* Fixed lava absorbant sponge not capturing lava. `LiquidSetEventArgs` now returns a `LiquidType` instead of a byte type. (@hakusaro)
* Fixed bottomless lava bucket from not being able to create lava. (@hakusaro)
  * Ban a lava bucket to ban lava on the server entirely, until we figure out a better way to handle liquids.
* Fixed scarab bombs not detonating on pick style tiles. (@hakusaro)
* Fixed dirt bombs not creating dirt. (@hakusaro)
* Added a ridiculous amount of debug information. If you're experiencing any problems with 1.4 items being caught by the TShock anticheat system, please turn on DebugLogs in your config file and capture log data. It'll be extremely helpful in narrowing down precisely how to fix your problem. (@hakusaro)
* Released with entangled support for 1.4.0.4 based on @Patrikkk local build and latest snapshot gen-dev. (@hakusaro)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 6)
* Updates to OTAPI 2.0.0.35 (@DeathCradle).

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 5)

* Updated changelog. (@hakusaro)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 4)
* Debug logging now provides ConsoleDebug and ILog has been updated to support the concept of debug logs. Debug logs are now controlled by `config.json` instead of by preprocessor debug flag. (@hakusaro)
* Removed `/confuse` command and Terraria player data resync from @Zidonuke. (@hakusaro)
* Attempted to fix the player desync issue by changing `LastNetPosition` logic and disabling a check in Bouncer that would normally reject player update packets from players. (@QuiCM, @hakusaro)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 3)
* Fixed `/worldmode` command to correctly target world mode. (@Ristellise)
* The following commands have been removed: `tbloodmoon`, `invade`, `dropmeteor`. `fullmoon`, `sandstorm`, `rain`, `eclipse`
* The following command has been added to replace them: `worldevent`. This command requires the `tshock.world.events` permission.
  * `worldevent` can be used as so: `worldevent [event type] [sub type] [wave (if invasion event)]`
  * Valid event types are `meteor`, `fullmoon`, `bloodmoon`, `eclipse`, `invasion`, `sandstorm`, `rain`
  * Valid sub types are `goblins`, `snowmen`, `pirates`, `pumpkinmoon`, `frostmoon` for invasions, and `slime` for rain.

* A new set of permissions has been added under the node `tshock.world.events`:
  * `tshock.world.events.bloodmoon`: Enables access to the `worldevent bloodmoon` command
  * `tshock.world.events.fullmoon`: Enables access to the `worldevent fullmoon` command
  * `tshock.world.events.invasion`: Enables access to the `worldevent invasion` command
  * `tshock.world.events.eclipse`: Enables access to the `worldevent eclipse` command
  * `tshock.world.events.sandstorm`: Enables access to the `worldevent sandstorm` command
  * `tshock.world.events.rain`: Enables access to the `worldevent rain` command
  * `tshock.world.events.meteor`: Enables access to the `worldevent meteor` command

Please note that the permissions previously tied to the removed commands are also still used to confirm access to the new commands, so if you have existing configurations no one should have any new or lost access.

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 2)
* Replaced `/expert` with `/worldmode` command. (@QuiCM)
* Fixed NPC buff anticheat issue conflicting with Terraria gameplay changes (whips). (@Patrikkk)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 1)
* Added confused debuff to Bouncer for confusion applied from Brain of Confusion
* API: Added return in OnNameCollision if hook has been handled. (@Patrikkk)
* API: Added hooks for item, projectile and tile bans (@deadsurgeon42)
* API: Changed `PlayerHooks` permission hook mechanisms to allow negation from hooks (@deadsurgeon42)
* API: New WorldGrassSpread hook which shold allow corruption/crimson/hallow creep config options to work (@DeathCradle)
* Fixed a missing case in UserManager exception handling, which caused a rather cryptic console error instead of the intended error message (@deadsurgeon42)
* Fixed saving when one player is one the server and another one joins (@MarioE)
* Fixed /spawnmob not spawning negative IDs (@MarioE)
* Validated tile placement on PlaceObject; clients can no longer place frames, paintings etc with dirt blocks (@bartico6, @ProfessorXZ)
* Updated to new stat tracking system with more data so we can actually make informed software decisions (Jordan Coulam)
* Fixed /time display at the end of Terraria hours (@koneko-nyan)
* Added a warning notifying users of the minimum memory required to run TShock (@bartico6)
* Added /group rename to allow changing group names (@ColinBohn, @ProfessorXZ)
* Added /region rename and OnRegionRenamed hook (@koneko-nyan, @deadsurgeon42)
* Rebuilt /ban add. New syntax is /ban add <target> [time] [reason] where target is the target online player, offline player, or IP; where time is the time format or 0 for permanent; and where [reason] is the reason. (@hakusaro)
* Removed /ban addip and /ban addtemp. Now covered under /ban add. (@hakusaro)
* Added /su, which temporarily elevates players with the tshock.su permission to super admin. In addition added, a new group, owner, that is suggested for new users to setup TShock with as opposed to superadmin. Finally, /su is implemented such that a 10 minute timeout will occur preventing people from just camping with it on. (@hakusaro)
* Added /sudo, which runs a command as the superadmin group. If a user fails to execute a command but can sudo, they'll be told that they can override the permission check with sudo. Much better than just telling them to run /su and then re-run the command. (@hakusaro)
* Fixed /savessc not bothering to save ssc data for people who bypass ssc. (@hakusaro)
* Default permission sets for new databases are more modern. (@hakusaro)

* Fixed DumpItems() from trying to dump older versions of certain items (negative item IDs). (@Zaicon)

* Added DateTime datatype support for both MySQL and SQLite. (@Ryozuki)
* Fixed builds to not require a specific version of OTAPI and to not fail when in Release mode (@bartico6)
* Update Assembly Company to Pryaxis (@Ryozuki)
* Removed `/restart` command. (@hakusaro)
* Removed `Permissions.updateplugins` permission. (@hakusaro)
* Removed REST `/v3/server/restart/` route and `/server/restart/` route. (@hakusaro)
* The "auth system" is now referred to as the initial setup system (what it actually is). This is better verbiage for basically all situations. Who really wants to turn off the "authentication system?" In addition, the system now makes it more clear what the point of it is, rather than that it grants permissions. (@hakusaro)
* `GetDataHandlers.SendTileSquare` hook now sends a `TSPlayer` and a `MemoryStream` of raw data. (@hakusaro)
* Added `GetDataHandlers.HealOtherPlayer` hook. (@hakusaro)
* Added `GetDataHandlers.PlaceObject` hook. (@hakusaro)
* `GetDataHandlers.KillMe` now sends a `TSPlayer` and a `PlayerDeathReason`. (@hakusaro)

* Added `TSPlayer` to `GetDataHandlers.NPCHome`. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer` to `GetDataHandlers.ChestItemChanged`. (@hakusaro)
* Fixed chest item changes not triggering any range checks, tile checks, or correct chest checks. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer` to `GetDataHandlers.PlayerBuff`. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer` and `PlayerDeathReason` to `GetDataHandlers.PlayerDamage`. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer` to `GetDataHandlers.NPCStrike`. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer` to `GetDataHandlers.PlayerAnimation`. (@hakusaro)
* Added `GetDataHandlers.MassWireOperation` hook and related arguments. (@hakusaro)
* Added `GetDataHandlers.PlaceTileEntity` hook and related arguments. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer` to `GetDataHandlers.GemLockToggle`. (@hakusaro)
* Added `GetDataHandlers.PlaceItemFrame` hook and related arguments. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer.IsBouncerThrottled()`. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer.IsBeingDisabled()` and removed `TShock.CheckIgnores(TSPlayer)`. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer.CheckIgnores()` and removed `TShock.CheckIgnores(TSPlayer)`. (@hakusaro)

* Fix stack hack detection being inconsistent between two different check points. Moved `TShock.HackedInventory` to `TSPlayer.HasHackedItemStacks`. Added `GetDataHandlers.GetDataHandledEventArgs` which is where most hooks will inherit from in the future. (@hakusaro)
* All `GetDataHandlers` hooks now inherit from `GetDataHandledEventArgs` which includes a `TSPlayer` and a `MemoryStream` of raw data. (@hakusaro)
* Removed _all obsolete methods in TShock marked obsolete prior to this version (all of them)_ (@hakusaro).
* Removed broken noclip detection and attempted prevention. TShock wasn't doing a good job at stopping noclip. It's always worse to claim that you do something that you can't/don't do, so removing this is better than keeping broken detection in. (@hakusaro)
* Replaced `Utils.FindPlayer` with `TSPlayer.FindByNameOrID` to more appropriately be object orientated. (@hakusaro)
* Moved `Utils.Kick()` to `TSPlayer` since its first argument was a `TSPlayer` object. (@hakusaro)
* Removed `Utils.ForceKick()`. (@hakusaro)
* Removed `Utils.GetPlayerIP()`. (@hakusaro)

  * Updated OnTeleport to support new args per protocol changes. (@hakusaro)
  * Disabled anticheat checks for projectile updates due to issues with game changes. (@hakusaro)

### Using the Crash Reporter

TShock now has a crash reporter built in which writes crash logs to the `crashes` directory
in the event of a catastrophic failure.  **To change where TShock writes its crash logs,
specify the `-crashdir` parameter on the command line**.

1. In the event of a crash, look for a file called `crash_xxxx.zip` in the `crashes` directory
2. Upload the file somewhere, beware the crash file may be quite large (>100MB), anywhere like google drive, dropbox or mega will be fine
3. Post a link to the crash with reproduction steps in the TShock support forum

Alternatively, if you do not want to report the crash, just delete the file.
