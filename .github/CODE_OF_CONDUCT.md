By participating in the TShock for Terraria community, all members will adhere to maintaining decorum with respect to all humans, in and out of the community. Members will not engage in discussion that inappropriately disparages or marginalizes any group of people or any individual. Members will not attempt to further or advance an agenda to the point of being overbearing or close minded (such as through spreading FUD). Members will not abuse services provided to them and will follow the guidance of community leaders on a situational basis about what abuse consists of. Members will adhere to United States and international law. If members notice a violation of this code of conduct, they will not engage but will instead contact the leadership team on either the forums or Discord.

Do not attempt to circumvent or bypass the code of conduct by using clever logic or reasoning (e.g., insulting Facepunch members, because they weren't directly mentioned here).
